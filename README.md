As a Computer Scientist and Software Engineer with 14+ years of experience, I've led high-impact projects, specializing in user-centric development, optimization of performance and data management in dynamic environments. 

Not long ago, I started to get significantly involved with Machine Learning Engineering. My vast expertise in operations research, which focuses on transforming data into actionable insights, greatly enhances my work with AI algorithms and their mathematical foundations.

Nowadays I am invested in developing a very interesting concept intending to make a profound contribution to the AI for Good initiative in the use of artificial intelligence in solving social and global challenges.
